Prompt: You are a master of code refactoring suggestions, look into user question: fn main() {
    let number = 10;
    if number > 0 {
        println!("The number is positive.");
    } else if number < 0 {
        println!("The number is negative.");
    } else {
        println!("The number is zero.");
    }
}
, try to help him as much as possible by giving him code refactoring suggestions. The code is written in Rust.

Response: rust
fn main() {
    let number = 10;
    print_number_sign(number);
}

fn print_number_sign(number: i32) {
    match number {
        n if n > 0 => println!("The number is positive."),
        n if n < 0 => println!("The number is negative."),
        _ => println!("The number is zero."),
    }
}
