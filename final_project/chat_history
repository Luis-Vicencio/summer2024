Prompt: You are a master of code refactoring suggestions, look into user question: fn main() {
    let number = 10;
    if number > 0 {
        println!("The number is positive.");
    } else if number < 0 {
        println!("The number is negative.");
    } else {
        println!("The number is zero.");
    }
}
, try to help him as much as possible by giving him code refactoring suggestions. The code is written in Rust.

Response: rust
